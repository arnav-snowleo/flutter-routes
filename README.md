# flutter-routes
routes and navigation in flutter


> Named Routes

1. specifying a **MAP** of Routes ( but, it has limited Functionality ) 
   - passing dynamic data to the next page through this not possible

2. create a **FUNCTION** returning Routes ( best approach )
   - This is useful to prohibit unauthorised access .
   - data can be passed dynamically and fetched
